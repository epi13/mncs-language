# Roadmap

This roadmap separates semantic research from final surface-language selection while treating recursive introspection, representation efficiency, machine-intent semantics, and refinement as cross-cutting requirements.

## Active cross-cutting track — source representations

The project now maintains an experimental syntax laboratory before committing to a grammar.

Current work:

- compare Zig-influenced, fully structured, and minimal human-source candidates;
- maintain a distinct compact canonical semantic form for agents and tooling;
- represent recursive changes as semantic patches rather than unrestricted text replacement;
- declare equivalent semantic claims before comparing candidate density;
- collect deterministic tokenizer-neutral metrics in CI;
- extend later studies with multiple model tokenizers, parser behavior, repair success, human comprehension, and verifier cost.

A final grammar must not be selected from character count alone.

## Active cross-cutting track — machine-intent expressions

[RFC 0006](rfcs/0006-machine-intent-expressions.md) proposes explicit semantic operations for
machine-oriented behavior that would otherwise depend on source idioms, undefined behavior,
unchecked compiler promises, or target folklore.

Current design work:

- separate exact semantics, intent, preferences, facts, requirements, and obligations;
- define explicit arithmetic edge behavior;
- model evidence-bearing memory, authority, and confinement capabilities;
- preserve closed dispatch, constant-time, layout, and target-specialization intent through IR;
- define lowering and portability envelopes;
- bind backend promises to current evidence;
- retain portable references and conservative fallbacks; and
- allow repeatedly verified non-orthodox techniques to graduate through explicit semantic review.

The first implementation pilot should remain narrow: integer arithmetic, one memory capability,
canonical serialization, IR preservation, and one conservative backend-promise experiment.

## 0.1 — Executable semantic model

**Goal:** demonstrate that MNCS relationships can be represented and mechanically checked before a source grammar exists.

Acceptance criteria:

- represent modules, functions, contracts, effects, capabilities, assumptions, evidence, and failure modes;
- reject an effect that lacks a declared authorizing capability;
- reject evidence that references an unknown property;
- report contracts that have no evidence;
- emit deterministic, machine-readable diagnostics;
- include accepted and intentionally rejected examples;
- document trust boundaries, recursive-refinement requirements, machine-intent direction, and non-goals;
- run formatting, linting, tests, example validation, and syntax measurements in CI.

## 0.2 — Semantic graph, identity, and recursive artifacts

- define stable identities for components, properties, assumptions, verifiers, artifacts, diagnostics, transformations, machine-intent operations, obligations, references, and realizations;
- model dependency and invalidation edges;
- define canonical serialization and content hashing;
- distinguish source identity, semantic identity, implementation identity, candidate identity, realization identity, and evidence identity;
- produce a first evidence-manifest schema;
- define schemas for diagnostic obligations, causal slices, repair proposals, refinement budgets, semantic deltas, evidence deltas, and promotion decisions;
- define facts, preferences, requirements, lowering envelopes, and portability envelopes as distinct semantic objects;
- ensure observation and mutation require distinct capabilities;
- version the canonical semantic representation independently from human syntax.

## 0.3 — High-level MNCS IR

- define typed state, transitions, ownership relationships, and regions;
- represent normal, error, compensation, and diagnostic paths;
- make effects and capability flow explicit;
- define deterministic lowering from the semantic graph;
- preserve source-to-semantic traceability;
- preserve machine-intent operation and obligation identities;
- represent explicit integer edge behavior without backend undefined behavior;
- preserve enough structure to identify bounded repair regions and protected properties;
- represent candidate transformations without modifying the trusted baseline;
- demonstrate lossless projection from human source to canonical semantic form for the supported subset.

## 0.4 — Verified SSA and micro-debugging

- introduce basic blocks, SSA values, phi-like joins, and explicit memory regions;
- attach proof obligations to transformations;
- define conservative aliasing and overflow semantics;
- implement the first evidence-bearing bounds or alignment capability;
- preserve machine-intent traceability through SSA lowering;
- ensure `UNKNOWN` obligations select only declared conservative fallbacks;
- integrate the first micro-verifier interfaces;
- demonstrate incremental invalidation after a local change;
- derive a machine-readable diagnostic obligation from a failed verifier;
- produce a minimal defensible causal slice;
- generate and evaluate at least one isolated repair proposal;
- compare the baseline and candidate across contracts, effects, capabilities, assumptions, complexity, target support, backend promises, and evidence;
- enforce recursion, authority, candidate-count, and verifier-call budgets.

## 0.5 — Backend and bounded recursive-refinement experiment

- lower a constrained subset to LLVM IR, Cranelift IR, or WebAssembly;
- emit optimization attributes only from verified facts;
- demonstrate wrapping, checked, saturating, trapping, and widening integer operations;
- record why backend no-overflow, in-bounds, alignment, non-aliasing, or relaxation promises are emitted or withheld;
- produce an executable and evidence manifest together;
- compare generated output with equivalent Rust or Zig implementations;
- bind target-specific realizations to compiler, backend, feature, ABI, and pass-pipeline identities;
- document all backend-introduced assumptions;
- complete one bounded observe–localize–propose–verify–compare–promote cycle;
- require independent evidence before automatic candidate promotion;
- retain an auditable record of accepted and rejected candidate transformations.

## 0.6 — Surface-language and self-description experiments

- expand the syntax tournament to a representative corpus;
- implement parsers and canonical formatters for at least two competing source candidates;
- include machine-intent expressions in syntax and semantic-density comparisons;
- measure human readability, agent generation, localized repair, model-token counts, parser recovery, canonical formatting, graph round trips, omission rates, and verifier workload;
- ensure every compared candidate represents the same declared semantic claims;
- avoid syntax that cannot round-trip to the semantic graph without hidden meaning;
- select or reject the Zig-influenced direction using collected evidence;
- expose compiler and verifier contracts, operation vocabularies, obligation templates, and lowering rules through the same introspection model used for ordinary programs;
- begin a limited self-hosting experiment without obscuring bootstrap trust;
- select a grammar only after semantic coverage and repairability are demonstrated.

## 0.7 — Target realizations and optimization regions

- bind portable reference semantics to at least two target-specific realizations;
- implement explicit target dispatch and conservative fallback;
- compare scalar and SIMD realizations under one semantic operation identity;
- add a bounded optimization-region model with mutation, target, authority, resource, candidate, and verifier limits;
- reject a faster candidate that violates a protected requirement;
- measure performance, code size, evidence cost, portability, and invalidation behavior;
- preserve accepted and rejected realization histories; and
- demonstrate stale evidence after target, compiler, backend, or pass-pipeline changes.

## 1.0 research threshold

A 1.0 designation would indicate a coherent research language and toolchain, not necessarily production maturity. It requires:

- a versioned specification;
- a stable semantic core;
- deterministic parsing and canonical formatting;
- a versioned canonical semantic representation;
- explicit machine-intent, obligation, lowering-envelope, and portability-envelope semantics;
- at least one executable backend;
- an evidence manifest with verifiable artifacts;
- conservative and traceable backend-promise emission;
- bounded unsafe and foreign-function interfaces;
- a versioned recursive diagnostic and refinement protocol;
- isolated candidate transformations and explicit promotion policy;
- documented recursion, authority, resource, target, and representation limits;
- documented soundness and bootstrap limits;
- conformance tests and independent implementation guidance.
